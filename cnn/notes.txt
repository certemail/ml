SUMMARY:
The objective of this assignment is to modify to cifar10 image dataset to classify only birds and horses using a convolutional neural network.  
Additionally, the original tutorial code was changed to intentionally decrease accuracy.  Three modifications to the code were made, which included 
1) the removal of image distortions, 2) removal of the second convolutional network along with pooling and normalization associated with that layer,
and 3) combination of image distortion and convolutional neural network removal

In order to modify the CNN to classify only birds and horses, the cifar10 dataset was preprocessed prior to input into the network.
The following is a summary of the changes were made to achieve this:
  - a custom python library was written to parse each data_batch_bin file and extract only bird and horse records (rebuild_cifar10_binary_dataset.py). this library is called from cifar10_train.py immediately following the dataset download and extraction
  - changed global constants in cifar10_input.py to reflect change from 10 classes to 2 classes

Other changes were made for convenience:
  - download and extraction of cifar10 dataset is to the current working directory (no longer to /tmp)
  - reduced number of steps from 100K to 10,000 to cut down the amount of time to run the classifier
  
INITIAL ACCURACY:
In order to execute the classifier with the baseline initial accuracy on the classification of only birds and horses:
% ] python cifar10_train.py

The baseline execution took ___ hours and ___ minutes and achieved an accuracy of _____
